## Course Overview

### Why Data Visualization?

Data is everywhere, but raw data alone doesn't tell stories. Effective data visualization
transforms complex information into clear, compelling narratives that drive decisions.
This module provides students with fundamental design principles, practical tools,
and hands-on experience in creating impactful visualizations. Students will learn
to apply the grammar of graphics, design effective charts, and build interactive
dashboards. Ultimately, the goal is to develop skills in transforming data into
actionable insights through thoughtful visual design.

### Course Topics (10 weeks)

1. **Week 1**: Designing charts: processes and principles
2. **Week 2**: Design variables and the grammar of graphics
3. **Week 3**: Exploratory data analysis and Nomis Solutions case
4. **Week 4**: Multidimensional data visualization and Saving Lives with Data case
5. **Week 5**: Storytelling and Crop Residue case
6. **Week 7**: Introduction to Tableau (Part 1)
7. **Week 8**: Introduction to Tableau (Part 2) and Accounting case
8. **Week 9**: Dashboards with Tableau (Part 1)
9. **Week 10**: Dashboards with Tableau (Part 2) and Market Street Wine case

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- **Design Foundation**: Understand fundamental principles of effective data visualization design
- **Technical Skills**: Apply the grammar of graphics to create meaningful visualizations
- **Tool Proficiency**: Design appropriate charts for different data types and analytical goals
- **Interactive Development**: Create interactive visualizations and dashboards using modern tools
- **Professional Implementation**: Leverage Python libraries and Tableau for professional visualizations
- **Communication**: Apply storytelling techniques to communicate data insights effectively
- **Business Application**: Produce elegant, effective visual solutions to practical problems in business analytics
