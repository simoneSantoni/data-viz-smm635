# Data Visualization, SMM635 ― README
This is the GitHub repository for the course Data Visualization, SMM635. The 
repo is alive and will be updated throughout the term.

## Why a Data Visualization Course?

This module is a journey into the art and science of creating memorable charts,
which grab the attention of the audience and successfully convey insights and
narratives. Pleasant journeys require good companions: infographic --- i.e., the
field that investigates the representation of information, data, and knowledge
--- will offer the theoretical platform for the module; Python will make things
happen (at least on our screen). Consistently with the teaching philosophy of
the module leader, each lecture integrates theory and practice.

## Learning Objectives
In terms of learning objectives, by the end of the module, students should be 
able to:

- Generate and evaluate visual forms for appropriateness, context, and 
meaning;
- Design and execute statistical charts with a particular emphasis on 
massive datasets;
- Design and execute multidimensional visualizations involving temporal 
and geo-spatial dimensions;
- Design and execute interactive visualizations;
- Leverage the visualization capabilities of best in class Python 
modules, namely, Matplotlib and Plotly, and specialized 
software such as Tableau and Tikz/PGF.
