## Why a Data Visualization course?

Data is everywhere, but raw data alone doesn't tell stories. Effective data visualization
transforms complex information into clear, compelling narratives that drive decisions.
This module provides students with fundamental design principles, practical tools,
and hands-on experience in creating impactful visualizations. Students will learn
to apply the grammar of graphics, design effective charts, and build interactive
dashboards. Ultimately, the goal is to develop skills in transforming data into
actionable insights through thoughtful visual design.

## Learning Objectives

In terms of learning objectives, by the end of the module, students will be
able to:

- Understand fundamental principles of effective data visualization design;
- Apply the grammar of graphics to create meaningful visualizations;
- Design appropriate charts for different data types and analytical goals;
- Create interactive visualizations and dashboards using modern tools;
- Leverage Python libraries and Tableau for professional visualizations;
- Apply storytelling techniques to communicate data insights effectively;
- Produce elegant, effective, and efficient visual solutions to practical
  problems in the field of business analytics.
