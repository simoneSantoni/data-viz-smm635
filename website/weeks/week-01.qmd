::: {.week-card}
## Overview
This week we'll explore what data visualization is, why it matters, and set up our development environment. We'll create our first visualizations and discuss the course structure.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the importance and applications of data visualization
- Set up a data visualization development environment
- Create basic plots using matplotlib and ggplot2
- Identify different types of data and appropriate visualizations
- Navigate course resources and tools

## Looking Ahead

Next week we'll dive into visual perception and design principles. Start thinking about visualizations you encounter in your daily life:
- What makes them effective or ineffective?
- How do they use color, shape, and position?
- What story are they trying to tell?
