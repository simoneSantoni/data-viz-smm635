title: "Week 4: Interactive Visualizations"
---

::: {.week-card}
## Overview
This week we'll learn how to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore data dynamically. We'll cover tooltips, filtering, brushing, and building interactive dashboards.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create interactive plots with tooltips and hover effects
- Implement filtering and selection mechanisms
- Build linked visualizations and brushing interactions
- Design effective interactive dashboards
- Choose appropriate levels of interactivity for different audiences

## Looking Ahead

Next week we'll focus on storytelling with data and creating narrative visualizations. Think about:
- What stories are hidden in your interactive visualizations?
- How can you guide users through discoveries?
- What insights emerge from exploration?
