Review examples of effective use of visual variables in data visualization

---
[^1]: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is R's powerful data visualization library based on the Grammar
of Graphics, enabling users to build complex, layered plots declaratively
through aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and flexible customization
options.

[^2]: [plotnine](https://plotnine.org/) is Python's implementation of R's ggplot2, providing Grammar of
Graphics-based visualization capabilities. It offers familiar syntax for R
users, enabling declarative plot construction through layered components,
aesthetics, and geometries for elegant data visualization.
