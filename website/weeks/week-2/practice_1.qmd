## Data Visualization

### Univariate Charts

#### Categorical Variables

@fig-bar-chart shows possible data quality issues: some cases present value $0$,
whose meaning is unclear in the context of this variable; other cases present 
missing values, displayed as $NaN$.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Counts of apps by pricing type
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-bar-chart

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = Type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The same information content can be displayed by using a pie chart as per @fig-pie-chart

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Pie charts can also be used to visualize categorical variables' univariate distributions
#| label: fig-pie-chart

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = "", fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void()
```

To explore the data quality issues further, we can filter and visualize only the 
cases where Type is neither "Free" nor "Paid." To do so, we can apply **ggplot**
functions over the ouput of a **dplyr**. @fig-type-issues 
indicates one case compatible with data regitration error ($Type == 1$) and 
one case that does not present a value for 

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Distribution of miscoded Type values
#| label: fig-type-issues

apps %>%
  filter(Type != "Free" & Type != "Paid") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

#### Continuous Variables

@fig-reviews-hist shows the distribution of apps by level of reviews. It is worth
noticing that **ggplot** groups the cases into 30 bins, that is ranges of variation
for $X$. To change the number of bins, populate the $\texttt{bins}$ optional 
argument.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Distribution of app reviews
#| label: fig-reviews-hist

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = Reviews)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The distribution of reviews is highly skewed. To better visualize the pattern, we 
can apply a log transformation to the x-axis as per @fig-reviews-hist-log.

```{r}
#| label: fig-reviews-hist-log
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Distribution of app reviews with log-transformed x-axis

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = Reviews)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()
```
To display the univariate distribution of a continuous variable, one can also 
use a boxplot, as shown in @fig-boxplot

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Distribution of app reviews with log-transformed x-axis

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = Reviews)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

By default, **ggplot** proposes a horizontal boxplot. To get a vertical boxplot, 
one has to populate the **y-axis** â€• as shown in @fig-boxplot-vertical â€• instead 
of the **x-axis** as in the previous example.

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot-vertical
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Distribution of app reviews with log-transformed x-axis

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(y = Reviews)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

Another way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is through a density plot, which shows a smoothed version of the distribution as shown in @fig-density.

```{r}
#| label: fig-density
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Density plot of app reviews with log-transformed x-axis

ggplot(data = apps, mapping = aes(x = Reviews)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_log10()
```
