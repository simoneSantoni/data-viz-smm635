## 📚 Prepare

Please read the case study:

> **“Using Data Analytics and Visualization in Accounting and Auditing at Toby Biotech Inc.”**  
> (Moodle → *Case Study* section)

As you read, pay **special attention** to the accounting-related terms and ideas, for example:
- Accounts Receivable (AR)  
- Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)  
- Reserve for Returns and Allowances (RRA)  
- Revenue recognition and timing  
- Materiality  
- CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss model)

You do **not** need to understand every technical detail,  
but you should have a basic sense of what each term means in the case.

📊 [Case Discussion Presentation](case_discussion.html) – Understanding the challenge of receivables risk at Toby Biotech

In class, we will:

- Walk through the **Toby Biotech** case together and discuss:
  - the company background  
  - the economic context  
  - why receivables and related estimates matter.

## Practice

::: {.callout-note}
## 💻 Practice

In the second part of the session, we will do a **hands-on exercise**:

- Use **Tableau** to explore the Toby Biotech datasets from the case.
- Build simple visualisations to:
  - see where receivables are concentrated, and  
  - start identifying patterns that might indicate risk.

## Perform

## 🧠 Perform

After class, take a few minutes to **mentally review**:

- What you understood about **receivables risk** from the Toby Biotech case;  
- Which Tableau view or pattern in the data stayed most clearly in your mind, and why;  
- What kinds of **Tableau skills** you feel you strengthened in this session and how you will use them in the future.

## Ponder

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Ponder

Think beyond what we actually did in class:

- If you had **more time** and access to the same data, what **additional analyses or visualisations** would you build on the Toby Biotech case?
- What **other questions** might an auditor, a manager, or a bond investor want to answer using this data?
- What **extra information or datasets** would you like to have, to make your conclusions about receivables risk more convincing?
