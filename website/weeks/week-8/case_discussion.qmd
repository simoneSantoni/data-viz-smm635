## Module A  
### The Context of This Case

## A1 · Who Is Toby Biotech?

- Toby Biotech Inc. is a **fictional global life sciences equipment firm**.
- Main product lines:
  - Instruments  
  - Consumables  
  - Software  
  - Services
- Main customers:
  - Research labs  
  - Hospitals and clinics  
  - Universities and public-sector organisations
- Toby sells high-value products **on credit** to professional customers,  
  so receivables are a natural and important part of the business.


## A2 · Economic Background

- The case takes place during a period of **global economic slowdown**:
  - Major markets are in or near recession.
  - Customers’ cash flows are under pressure.
- Typical effects in this environment:
  - More sales are done **on credit** instead of cash.
  - Customers **take longer to pay**.
  - Companies see **more product returns** and stronger pressure for **price concessions**.
- In this setting, receivables become a key place where financial risks can build up,  
  and some reported numbers may become less reliable.


## A3 · Toby’s 20X3 Financial Snapshot (Unaudited)

- **Net sales revenue (20X3)**: about **$1.132 billion**
- **Pre-tax income (20X3)**: about **$218 million**
- **Year-end accounts receivable (AR)**:
  - $177 million at 31 Dec 20X3  
  - Increase of **$19 million (≈12%)** over the prior year
- **Sales vs. AR growth**
  - Sales have grown by roughly **10%** year-on-year.  
  - AR has grown by roughly **12%**, so receivables are increasing **faster than sales**.
- In a weak economy, this pattern raises questions about  
  how quickly customers are paying and how realistic the reported AR balance is.


## Module B  
### Core Accounting Ideas (for Non-Accounting Students)


## B1 · Accounts Receivable (AR)

- **Accounts Receivable (AR)**  
  - Money that customers owe Toby for goods or services already delivered  
  - Reported as an **asset** on the balance sheet
- Key idea:
  - AR is a good asset **only if customers actually pay**.  
  - If they do not pay, AR turns into credit losses.
- In this case, we will use Tableau to understand **where this AR sits**:
  - Which countries and cities  
  - Which sales offices  
  - Which customers


## B2 · Adjusting AR for Risk: ACL & RRA

- **Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)**  
  - Management’s estimate of receivables that **will not be collected**  
  - Higher ACL → more bad-debt expense → lower profit and **lower net AR**
- **Reserve for Returns and Allowances (RRA)**  
  - Expected future **product returns** and **post-sale price concessions**  
  - Higher RRA → lower revenue → lower profit and **lower net AR**

> **Net AR = Gross AR – ACL – RRA**

- If management is **too optimistic**, ACL and RRA may be **too low**,  
  which makes AR and profit look better than they really are.


## B3 · Why CECL Was Introduced

- Historically, many firms used an **“incurred loss” model**:
  - Losses were recognised mainly when there was clear evidence of trouble  
    (missed payments, defaults, downgrades, etc.).
  - This often made loss recognition **too slow and too small**,  
    especially before and during the 2008 financial crisis.
- Regulators wanted a more **forward-looking** approach:
  - One that forces firms to consider not just past problems,  
    but also what is likely to go wrong in the future.


## B4 · The CECL Model

- Under the **Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL)** model, firms must:
  - Estimate **lifetime expected credit losses** on receivables.
  - Use:
    - Past experience  
    - Current conditions  
    - Reasonable and supportable forecasts
- This means:
  - The allowance reflects not only what has already gone bad,  
    but also what is **expected** to go bad over the life of the receivable.
- In our case:
  - In a weakening economy, CECL pushes Toby to **raise ACL earlier and more aggressively**, rather than waiting for customers to actually default.
  - If AR is growing faster than sales but ACL does not respond, the reported AR and profit may be **too optimistic**.


## B5 · Revenue Recognition & Timing

- **Revenue recognition** determines:
  - **When** and **how much** revenue is recorded
- Aggressive revenue recognition:
  - Records revenue **earlier** in the process  
  - Can temporarily inflate **revenue, AR, and EPS**
- Under CECL, even if revenue is recognised early:
  - Companies are expected to record **expected credit losses** on those receivables at the same time.
  - If revenue is recognised aggressively **without** adjusting ACL,  
  the financial statements can become misleading.
- In a downturn, pressure to “hit the numbers” can still lead to:
  - Looser credit policies  
  - Delayed recognition of losses in practice  
  - Heavy use of returns and allowances to quietly adjust results


## Module C  
### Stakeholders & Their Incentives


## C1 · Toby Management’s Perspective

- Key players: **CFO, Controller, CRO**
- Main objectives:
  - **Meet or beat analyst EPS expectations**  
  - Maintain a strong **credit rating** for a planned bond issue
- Under pressure, management may:
  - Stretch credit terms to keep sales volume up  
  - Delay recognising credit losses and returns  
  - Underestimate ACL and RRA to support reported profit


## C2 · TRG Audit Team’s Perspective

- TRG LLP is Toby’s **external auditor**.
- Main responsibility:
  - Provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are **fairly presented**
- In this engagement, TRG:
  - Sets overall materiality at about **4% of pre-tax income**  
  - Focuses on risk of **overstatement** in:
    - Net AR  
    - Revenue  
    - ACL and RRA
- The audit team must decide:
  - Where to concentrate audit effort  
  - What extra evidence to collect


## C3 · Investors and Lenders

- Investors and bondholders care about:
  - **Quality of earnings**, not just the earnings level  
  - Ability to **generate cash** and repay debt
- Small changes around EPS targets or leverage ratios can:
  - Move Toby’s **share price**  
  - Affect the **interest rate** demanded by lenders
- Because of this, the way Toby estimates ACL and RRA,  
  and how realistic its revenue is, matters directly to capital markets.

## Module D  
### From Data Tables to Risk Patterns

In this section, we will:

- Dive into Toby’s receivables data
- See what kinds of **risks and patterns** are hiding in the ledgers
- Use a few simple **visualisations** to understand the data

## D1 · What Is in This Dataset?

## D1 · What Is in This Dataset?
This case dataset brings together **four types of information**:

- Client information  
- Invoice information  
- Return information  
- Allowance information  

## D1a · Client Information

- Which organisations are Toby’s customers  
- Where they are located  
  - Customer city  
  - Customer country  
- Which sales office is responsible for each customer  
  - Sales office city  
  - Sales office country  

## D1b · Invoice Information

- Individual sales transactions:
  - Invoice ID / invoice number  
  - Invoice date  
  - Invoice amount  
- These invoices are what **build up** the receivables balance:
  - More invoices → higher AR  
  - Larger invoices → more exposure in a single transaction  

## D1c · Return Information

- When customers send products back:
  - Return date  
  - Days between invoice and return  
- How much revenue is reversed:
  - Return amount  
  - Invoice net of return (what is left after returns)  

## D1d · Allowance Information

- Post-sale price concessions and credits:
  - Allowance amount  
  - Allowance date  
  - Days between invoice and allowance  
- How large the concession is compared with the invoice:
  - Allowance percentage  
  - Invoice net of allowance  

## D2 · Four Lenses on the Same Story

We will explore Toby’s receivables through four blocks:

1. **Block 1 – Customer balance**  
   - Where is the money? (countries, cities, sales offices, customers)

2. **Block 2 – Invoices**  
   - How big are the invoices, and how old are the receivables?

3. **Block 3 – Returns**  
   - Are products coming back? When, and from whom?

4. **Block 4 – Allowances**  
   - Where is Toby “cutting price after the fact”?

**For each block we will:**

- Start with **clear business questions**  
- Build a few simple Tableau **visualisations**  
- Discuss the insights from the **visualisations**

## D3 · Block 1 – Customer Balance Questions

When you explore the **customer balance** data, think about:

- Which **countries or cities** show the largest **AR balances**?
- Which **sales offices** are responsible for the biggest **AR balances**?
- Are there a few **customers** that account for a large share of total AR?
- If one **country / city / sales office / customer** ran into trouble,
  how much of Toby’s receivables would be at risk?

## D5 · Block 2 – Invoices Questions

When you explore the **invoice** data, think about:

- Are most invoices **small and similar**,  
  or do a few **very large invoices** dominate the total?
- How are invoices distributed **over time**  
  (by month or by quarter)? Do you see any **spikes**?
- Do you see signs of **older, slow-moving invoices**  
  that have not been collected for a long time?

## D6 · Block 3 – Returns Questions

When you explore the **returns** data, think about:

- Do most returns happen **soon after the sale**,  
  or do many returns happen **a long time later**?
- Which customers have **high total return amounts**  
  or **very frequent returns**?
- Are there invoices where returns remove **most or all** of the original sale?

## D7 · Block 4 – Allowances Questions

When you explore the **allowances** data, think about:

- When are allowances granted:  
  mostly **shortly after invoicing**, or often **long after the sale**?
- How large are allowances as a **percentage of the original invoice amount**?
- Are there customers who **regularly receive large concessions**?
- Do you see any **unusual patterns**:  
  for example, allowances that almost wipe out the original invoice?

## D8 · Module D – Reflection Questions

After you have explored all four blocks, think about:

- Where does the **receivables risk** seem most concentrated  
  (by region, office, customer, or invoice type)?
- Which patterns would make you **doubt** whether ACL or RRA are high enough?
- If you were the **audit team**,  
  which customers, regions, or time periods would you want to **investigate further**,  
  based on the patterns you saw in the data?
