title: "Week 2: Visual Perception & Design Principles"
---

::: {.week-card}
## Overview
This week we'll explore how humans perceive visual information and apply design principles to create effective visualizations. We'll learn about color theory, cognitive load, and accessibility.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand how the human visual system processes information
- Apply pre-attentive attributes in visualization design
- Use color effectively and accessibly
- Reduce cognitive load through good design
- Create visualizations that follow design principles

## Lecture Slides

ðŸ“Š [Visual Perception & Design](../slides/week02-perception.pdf)

**Topics covered:**
- How we see: the visual system
- Pre-attentive attributes
- Color theory and accessibility
- Gestalt principles
- Reducing cognitive load

## Readings

### Required
- Cairo, A. (2016). *The Truthful Art*, Chapter 6: "The Eye and the Visual Brain"
- Wilke, C. (2019). [Chapter 4: Color Scales](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html)

### Optional
- [ColorBrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/) - Explore color schemes
- [Viz Palette](https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette) - Test color accessibility

**Applying Design Principles**

In this lab, you will:
- Redesign poorly designed visualizations
- Apply color theory principles
- Test accessibility compliance
- Create visualization critiques
- Practice with different chart types

**Due:** Friday at 11:59 PM

## Resources

### Tools
- [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) - Color blindness simulator

## Looking Ahead

Next week we'll focus on choosing the right chart type for your data and message. Start noticing:
- How different publications use color
- Which visualizations are easy vs. difficult to read
- How color affects your interpretation of data

## Pro Tip
Use your phone's accessibility settings to test how your visualizations look with different vision types. Most phones have built-in color blindness simulators.
