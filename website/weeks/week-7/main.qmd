## 📝 Perform

Using the Netflix dataset, reflect on the following questions. You will work individually.

1. **One country’s structure and trends**
   - Choose one country of interest.
   - What does Netflix’s content from this country look like in terms of Movies vs TV Shows?
   - How has the number of titles from this country changed over the years (by release year)? Are there any noticeable shifts or trends over time?

2. **Rating structure within a main genre**
   - Choose one main genre (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Documentary).
   - How are titles in this genre distributed across different rating categories?
   - Do certain ratings dominate within this genre?
   - What does this suggest about the typical audience for this genre on Netflix?

3. **Country catalogue size vs “recency” of content**
   - Think of each country as one observation.
   - How do countries differ in terms of the size of their catalogues?
   - How do they differ in how “recent” their catalogues are?
   - Which countries stand out as outliers or interesting groups when you consider catalogue size and recency together?
