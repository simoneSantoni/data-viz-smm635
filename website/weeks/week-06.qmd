title: "Week 6: Advanced Visualization Techniques"
---

::: {.week-card}
## Overview
This week we'll explore advanced visualization techniques including small multiples, animation, network diagrams, and geographic visualizations. We'll learn when and how to use these sophisticated approaches effectively.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create small multiples and faceted visualizations
- Design effective animated visualizations
- Build network and tree diagrams
- Create geographic visualizations and maps
- Choose advanced techniques appropriately for your data and audience

## Lecture Slides

ðŸ“Š [Advanced Visualization Techniques](../slides/week06-advanced.pdf)

**Topics covered:**
- Small multiples and faceting strategies
- Animation principles and timing
- Network visualization layouts and aesthetics
- Geographic data and map projections
- When to use advanced techniques

## Readings

### Required
- Tufte, E. (2001). *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, Chapter 4: "Small Multiples"
- Wilke, C. (2019). [Chapter 21: Multi-panel Figures](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/multi-panel-figures.html)

### Optional

**Advanced Techniques Workshop**

In this lab, you will:
- Create small multiples with consistent scales
- Build an animated visualization showing change over time
- Design a network diagram or geographic visualization
- Compare static vs. animated approaches
- Optimize performance for complex visualizations

## Looking Ahead

Next week we'll focus on data ethics and responsible visualization practices. Reflect on:
- How can advanced techniques mislead audiences?
- What responsibilities do we have as visualization creators?
- When does sophistication become counterproductive?

## Pro Tip
Advanced doesn't always mean better. Use sophisticated techniques only when they genuinely improve understanding or reveal important patterns.
