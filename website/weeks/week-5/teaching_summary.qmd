## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Key Questions to Explore:**

- How many farmers participated in 2019 vs 2020?
- How many farmers adopted CRM across states/districts?
- Land size comparisons across states and districts
- Has water and fertilizer consumption changed?
- What tools are farmers using and how did they source them?
- Tool performance (time taken per acre)

::: {.fragment}
**Start Simple:** Use descriptive statistics, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand distributions and outliers.
:::

---

## Key Insights from 2019-2020 Comparison {.smaller}

**Maps & Butterfly Charts** - Best for temporal comparison

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**2019 Baseline:**

- 1,599 farmers surveyed
- 4 districts (Patiala, Ludhiana, Sirsa, Fatehabad)
- 46% sustainable adoption
- 50% still burning
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**2020 Progress:**

- 2,159 farmers surveyed
- 7 districts (+Sangrur, Barnala, Rohtak)
- **89% sustainable adoption** 🎉
- Only 11% burning/partial burning
:::

::::

::: {.callout-important}
## Major Achievement
Sustainable practice adoption nearly doubled from 46% to 89% in just one year!
:::

---

## Farmer Feedback Analysis {.smaller}

**Comparing Benefits: 2019 vs 2020**

| Impact Area | 2019 (Decreased) | 2020 (Decreased) | Trend |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Water Consumption** | 69% | 71% | ↗️ Improving |
| **Fertilizer Consumption** | 60% | 80% | ⬆️ Major improvement |
| **Weed Infestation** | 33% | 53% | ⬆️ Much better |
| **Pest Infestation** | 31% | 31% | ➡️ Stable |

::: {.callout-note}
69-71% of farmers report reduced water consumption - critical for water-scarce Punjab and Haryana!
:::

---

## Tool Usage & Availability {.smaller}

**Most Popular Tools for CRM (2020):**

1. **Rotavator** (1,095 farmers) - Most accessible
   - Average time: 1.7 hrs/acre
   - Source: Cooperatives & ownership

2. **Super Seeder** (838 farmers) - Most efficient
   - Average time: 1.1 hrs/acre
   - Limited availability

3. **Mulcher** (423 farmers)
   - Average time: 1.9 hrs/acre
   - Moderate availability

::: {.callout-warning}
**Challenge:** Tool availability doesn't match efficiency. Super-SMS takes only 1.1 hrs/acre but few farmers can access it!
:::

---

## The Seven Basic Data Story Types

1. **Change Over Time** - Gradual metric changes
2. **Drill Down** - Big picture → focused view
3. **Zoom Out** - Hyper-local → big picture
4. **Contrasts** - Differences between data points
5. **Intersection** - What happens when data crosses
6. **Factors** - Explain what leads to a metric
7. **Outliers** - Insights from unusual data

::: {.fragment}
**For CRM Data:** Use **Drill Down**, **Factors**, and **Contrasts** story types

(Limited time series makes Change Over Time and Intersection less useful)
:::

---

## Applying Story Types: Drill Down {.smaller}

**Start Broad → Get Specific**

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Level 1: Overall**

89% sustainable adoption across both states
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
**Level 2: By State**

- Haryana: 16% farmers
- Punjab: 63% farmers (higher adoption)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
**Level 3: By District**

- Fatehabad: High collection method
- Punjab districts: Strong soil incorporation
:::

::::

::: {.fragment}
This reveals that **different districts prefer different methods** - important for customizing interventions!
:::

---

## Applying Story Types: Factors {.smaller}

**What influences CRM method adoption?**

```

## Data Storytelling Framework

**For Pradhan's Presentation to Funders:**

1. **Hook** - Delhi's air pollution crisis (AQI > 450)
2. **Context** - CRB contributes 36% of NCR pollution
3. **Conflict** - Farmers need quick field clearing (15-20 days)
4. **Solution** - CII's CRM initiative with alternatives
5. **Evidence** - Show the 46% → 89% adoption data
6. **Impact** - Demonstrate environmental & economic benefits
7. **Call to Action** - Need for scaling & continued funding

---

## Storyboarding Best Practices {.smaller}

**Structure your narrative in 5-7 slides:**

1. **Problem Slide** - The pollution crisis with visuals
2. **Initiative Overview** - CRM program details, coverage
3. **Adoption Success** - The 89% sustainable adoption stat
4. **District Breakdown** - Geographic patterns & preferences
5. **Tool Analysis** - What farmers use and why
6. **Farmer Benefits** - Feedback data on reduced consumption
7. **Recommendations** - Scaling strategy & funding needs

::: {.callout-tip}
## Design Principle
Each slide should tell ONE key insight. Use data visualization to support, not overwhelm.
:::

---

## Visualization Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Chart:**

- **Butterfly Charts** - Comparing two time periods by category
- **Tree Maps** - Showing hierarchical data (districts within states)
- **Stacked Bars** - Part-to-whole relationships (% adoption)
- **Box Plots** - Distribution and outliers (land sizes)
- **Maps** - Geographic patterns (district coverage)

::: {.fragment}
**Remember:** Maximize data-ink ratio - remove unnecessary elements!
:::

---

## Interactive Visualizations

**Engage your audience with:**

- **Dropdown Filters** - Let users select year, state, or district
- **Hover Details** - Show exact values on demand
- **Drill-Through** - Click district to see farmer details
- **Highlight Actions** - Select one category to see it across all charts

::: {.callout-note}
**Tableau/Power BI Tip:** Interactive dashboards let stakeholders explore data at their own pace and ask their own questions.
:::

---

## Critical Thinking Questions {.smaller}

**For Class Discussion:**

1. **Data Quality:** What biases might exist in self-reported farmer surveys?

2. **Causality:** Can we prove the initiative caused the adoption increase, or are there confounding factors?

3. **Sustainability:** The data shows adoption, but will farmers continue these practices long-term?

4. **Scalability:** What evidence suggests this model will work in other states?

5. **Economic Viability:** Do the benefits outweigh costs for individual farmers?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In Data Analysis:**

- Confusing correlation with causation
- Ignoring selection bias
- Over-interpreting small differences
- Failing to account for outliers
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In Visualization:**

- Too many colors/categories
- 3D charts (distort perception)
- Dual y-axes (misleading)
- Chartjunk (unnecessary decoration)
- Missing context (no labels/legends)
:::

::::

---

## Recommendations for Pradhan {.smaller}

**To Convince Funding Agencies:**

1. **Lead with Impact** - Show the 89% adoption headline first
2. **Use Comparison Visuals** - 2019 vs 2020 butterfly charts
3. **Highlight Co-Benefits** - Water & fertilizer savings (not just air quality)
4. **Show Geographic Reach** - Maps demonstrate scale
5. **Address Barriers** - Tool availability data shows what's needed
6. **Quantify Needs** - Specific districts, tools, training requirements
7. **ROI Projection** - Link environmental benefits to economic value

---

## Key Metrics to Track {.smaller}

**For Monitoring & Evaluation:**

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Adoption Metrics:**

- % farmers adopting sustainable practices
- % land area with zero burning
- Number of villages/districts covered
- Farmer retention rate year-over-year
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Impact Metrics:**

- Reduction in fire incidents (satellite data)
- Air quality improvement (AQI)
- Water consumption changes
- Fertilizer cost savings
- Tool rental/ownership rates
:::

::::

::: {.callout-important}
Combine survey data with objective measures (satellite imagery, AQI readings) for credibility.
:::

---

## Policy Implications

**What the data tells policymakers:**

1. **Behavioral change is possible** - With right support, 89% adoption achievable
2. **Tool access is critical** - Need subsidies/cooperatives for equipment
3. **One-size doesn't fit all** - District-specific preferences require flexible policies
4. **Long-term commitment needed** - This isn't a one-year fix
5. **Market creation** - Support for ex-situ methods needs end-use markets

::: {.fragment}
**Bottom line:** Stubble burning is a behavioral issue requiring financial support AND long-term policy framework.
:::
