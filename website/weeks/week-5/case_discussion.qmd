## The Problem: Air Pollution Crisis in Delhi NCR {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Every winter, Delhi faces severe air pollution**

- November 2021: AQI > 450 (hazardous)
- Health impacts: respiratory issues, eye irritation, headaches
- Major contributor: **Crop residue burning** in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh

**Why do farmers burn crop residue?**

- Quick and cost-effective
- 15-20 day window between rice harvest and wheat sowing
- Mechanized harvesting leaves stubble in fields
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Impact of the practice:**

- 36% of Delhi's air pollution from crop burning
- Low wind speeds trap smoke over Delhi NCR
- Reduces soil health and microbial activity
- Increases irrigation requirements
- Loss of organic matter

## The CII Crop Residue Management Initiative {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Program Overview**

- Partnership with NITI Aayog
- Started in 2018 in Punjab's Patiala and Ludhiana
- Expanded to 226 villages across 10 districts by 2021
- Reached 40,040 farmers, covering 199,867 acres

**Key Results**

- 89% of farm area achieved zero or significantly reduced burning
- 80% farmer adoption of sustainable practices in pilot areas
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Intervention Strategies**

1. **Awareness building** - Mass campaigns on environmental impact
2. **Machinery deployment** - Access to tools through cooperatives
3. **Technical training** - Proper use of equipment
4. **Participatory management** - Handholding farmers through transition

**Funding Sources**

- Corporate CSR funds
- Government support
- Policy framework development

## Sustainable Alternatives: In Situ vs Ex Situ Methods {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In Situ (In-Field) Methods**

*Straw incorporation and mulching*

**Advantages:**

- Retains water, nutrients, organic matter
- Improves soil health and microorganisms
- Reduces irrigation needs

**Requirements:**

- Access to specialized equipment
- Rotavators, super seeders, mulchers
- Suitable subsoil conditions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ex Situ (Ex-Field) Methods**

*Collection and baling*

**Advantages:**

- Works with all soil types
- Straw can be sold or repurposed
- Creates additional income stream

**Applications:**

- Animal bedding and feed (limited for rice)
- Biomass energy production
- Composting
- Industrial uses

**Success in other countries:** China, Australia, East Asian nations have banned burning and adopted these methods

## The Challenge: Convincing Stakeholders {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pradhan's Dilemma**

Chandrakant Pradhan needs to convince funding agencies to scale up the CRM initiative

**Key Questions:**

- How to effectively present survey data?
- What insights demonstrate program success?
- Is there evidence of long-term pollution reduction?
- How to show the ground reality faced by farmers?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Available Data from Surveys**

- Farmer details: state, district, village, land size
- CRM practices adopted (2019 vs 2020)
- Tools used and their sources
- Farmer feedback on:
  - Water consumption changes
  - Fertilizer consumption
  - Weed infestation
  - Pest infestation

**The Power of Data Storytelling**

> *"Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice."* — Stephen Few

## Discussion Questions {.smaller}

**For Class Discussion:**

1. **Data Exploration:** What are the most important metrics to track in the CRM survey data? How would you measure the success of the initiative?

2. **Stakeholder Perspectives:** Different stakeholders (corporates, policymakers, farmers) have different priorities. How should Pradhan tailor his data story for each audience?

3. **Behavioral Change:** Stubble burning is described as a "behavioral issue." What role does data visualization play in changing farmer behavior versus providing financial incentives?

4. **Sustainability vs Practicality:** Given that farmers have only 15-20 days between harvests, what barriers exist to adoption of sustainable practices? How does the data reveal these constraints?

5. **Scaling Up:** Based on the case, what evidence would convince you (as a potential funder) to invest in expanding this program to other states?

---

**Think about:** How would you use the survey data to tell a compelling story that balances environmental urgency with practical farmer constraints?
