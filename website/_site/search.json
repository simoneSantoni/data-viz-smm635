A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We‚Äôll cover the essentials for network analysis.\nQ: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT? A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.\nQ: What if I‚Äôm falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic network analysis doesn‚Äôt require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Should I use R or Python for network analysis? A: Both are excellent. We‚Äôll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.",

Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (people connected to people)\nCitation networks (papers citing papers)\nTrade networks (countries trading with countries)\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of creating a one-mode network visualization concerning a collaboration network among five co-workers:\n\n\nDirected Vs Undirected Networks\nDirected networks (also called digraphs) have edges with a specific direction, indicating asymmetric relationships where the connection flows from one vertex to another. Examples include:\n\nEmail networks (sender ‚Üí receiver)\nCitation networks (citing paper ‚Üí cited paper)\n\nFood webs (predator ‚Üí prey)\nTwitter follower networks (follower ‚Üí followed)\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a directed network:\nUndirected networks have edges without direction, representing symmetric relationships where connections are mutual. Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (mutual friendships)\nCo-authorship networks (collaborations)\nInfrastructure networks (roads, power grids)\nProtein interaction networks\n\nThe choice between directed and undirected representation depends on whether the relationship being modeled is inherently asymmetric or symmetric.\n\n\nTwo-mode Networks\nTwo-mode networks (also called bipartite networks) contain two distinct types of vertices, and edges only connect vertices of different types. Examples include:\n\nActor-movie networks (actors connected to movies they appear in)\nAuthor-paper networks (authors connected to papers they wrote)\nCustomer-product networks (customers connected to products they purchased)\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a two-mode purchasing network:\n\n\n\nSigned Networks\nSigned networks are networks where edges carry positive or negative values, representing different types of relationships:\n\nPositive edges: friendship, alliance, cooperation\nNegative edges: animosity, conflict, competition\n\nSigned networks are particularly useful for studying:\n\nSocial balance theory\nCoalition formation\nConflict dynamics\nOpinion polarization\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a signed social network like cooperative Vs. competitive ties among co-workers:\n\n\nWeighted vs Unweighted Networks\n\nWeighted Networks\nWeighted networks have edges with numerical values (weights) representing the strength, frequency, or capacity of connections. Examples include:\n\nCommunication networks (number of messages exchanged)\nTransportation networks (traffic volume or distance)\nNeural networks (synaptic strength)\nFinancial networks (transaction amounts)\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a weighted communication network:\n\n\nUnweighted Networks\nUnweighted networks (also called binary networks) have edges that simply indicate the presence or absence of a connection. All edges are treated equally, focusing on the topology rather than connection strength. These are simpler to analyze but may lose important information about relationship intensity."

The library enables users to construct complex visualizations by combining data, aesthetic mappings, geometric objects (geoms), statistical transformations, scales, coordinate systems, facets, and themes. This layered grammar promotes principled, reproducible graphics with exceptional flexibility, making ggplot2 the de facto standard for publication-quality visualizations in R and a model for visualization libraries across programming languages."

    "text": "ggplot2 is R‚Äôs premier visualization library and the canonical implementation of the Grammar of Graphics. Created by Hadley Wickham, it revolutionized data visualization by providing a coherent system for declaratively building plots through layered components. The library enables users to construct complex visualizations by combining data, aesthetic mappings, geometric objects (geoms), statistical transformations, scales, coordinate systems, facets, and themes. This layered grammar promotes principled, reproducible graphics with exceptional flexibility, making ggplot2 the de facto standard for publication-quality visualizations in R and a model for visualization libraries across programming languages."
