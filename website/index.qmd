Welcome to the course website for **SMM635 - Data Visualization** 

This module will teach you how to create effective and beautiful data visualizations using modern tools and techniques. You'll learn both the theory behind good visualization design and practical skills in Python and R.

## Course overview

Data visualization is the art and science of transforming data into visual representations that effectively communicate insights, patterns, and stories. In this module, you will:

- Learn fundamental principles of visual perception and design
- Master data visualization tools including matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2, and plotly
- Create static and interactive visualizations
- Develop skills in exploratory data analysis
- Build compelling data stories and dashboards
- Work with different data types: temporal, spatial, network, and text data

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Design** effective visualizations following perceptual and aesthetic principles
2. **Create** publication-quality static visualizations using Python and R
3. **Develop** interactive visualizations and dashboards
4. **Critique** visualizations based on established design principles
5. **Communicate** data insights through visual storytelling

## Course materials

All course materials, including lecture slides, lab notebooks, and datasets, will be posted on this website. We will primarily use:

- Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, altair)
- R (ggplot2, plotly, shiny)
- Tableau (for rapid prototyping)
- D3.js (introduction to web-based visualizations)

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills in Python or R
- Understanding of basic statistics
- No prior visualization experience required!
