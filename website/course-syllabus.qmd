## Course Description

SMM635 Data Visualization is a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practice of data visualization. This module combines theoretical foundations with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools and programming languages. Students will learn to create effective, ethical, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that communicate complex data insights to diverse audiences.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** the effectiveness of data visualizations using principles of visual perception and design
2. **Design** appropriate visualizations for different data types and communication objectives
3. **Implement** static and interactive visualizations using Python, R, and web technologies
4. **Evaluate** the ethical implications of design choices in data visualization
5. **Create** comprehensive data stories that effectively communicate insights

## Module Structure

The module runs for 10 weeks with the following components:

- **Lectures** (2 hours/week): Theory, principles, and case studies
- **Labs** (2 hours/week): Hands-on coding and visualization practice
- **Self-study** (6 hours/week): Readings, tutorials, and assignments

## Assessment
