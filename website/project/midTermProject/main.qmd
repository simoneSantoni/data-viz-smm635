## Project Overview

The mid-term project is a **group assignment** that requires you to apply
data visualization methodologies to solve a real business problem. You will work
with the case study "Nomis Solutions B" to demonstrate your understanding of
data visualization and analytical techniques.

- All team members must participate in the presentation
- Be ready to answer technical and business questions
- Presentation schedule available in due course

## Getting Help

### Office Hours
- **When**: Wednesdays 15:00 - 17:00, or by appointment
- **Where**: Faculty office or online (schedule via email)
- **Purpose**: Methodology guidance, technical support, feedback on progress

### Resources
- **Course materials**: Slides, readings, and case discussions
- **Peer collaboration**: Discuss concepts (but not share solutions) with other teams

### Academic Integrity

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Reminders

- **Collaboration within teams** is expected and encouraged
- **Collaboration between teams** should be limited to conceptual discussions
- **All sources** must be properly cited using academic citation standards
- **Code originality**: While you may reference online resources, the analysis must be your own work
- **Data integrity**: Do not modify the provided dataset beyond standard preprocessing

## Success Tips

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recommendations for Success

1. **Start early**: Data visualization can present substantial uncertainty
2. **Plan your approach**: Discuss methodology before diving into coding
3. **Iterate frequently**: Regular team check-ins and progress reviews
4. **Focus on business value**: Always connect technical findings to business implications
5. **Document everything**: Keep detailed notes of your analytical choices and assumptions
6. **Practice your presentation**: Rehearse timing and smooth transitions between speakers
:::

Good luck with your mid-term project! This is an excellent opportunity to
apply data visualization to real-world challenges and develop skills highly
valued in today's data-driven business environment.
