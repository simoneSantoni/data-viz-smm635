title: "Final Course Project"
subtitle: "Flying Around Real Estate Development: Persuading with Data Visualizations"
---

## Project Overview

The final project is an **individual assignment** that challenges you to apply
data visualization principles to address a complex business decision with
competing considerations. You will work with the case study "Flying Around
Real Estate Development: Persuading with Data Visualizations" (UVA-BC-0285) to
demonstrate your mastery of persuasive visualization and storytelling with
data.[^1]

### The Business Challenge

You are Logan Clausen, a project manager at Pitchard Development Company
(PDC), a boutique real estate development firm in San Francisco. You have
identified a promising mixed-use development opportunity near a municipal
airport. However, the proximity to the airport raises critical questions:

- Does airport proximity increase or decrease property value?
- How do noise levels (measured in CNEL decibels) impact housing prices?
- Are there market segments that actively seek airport proximity?
- How can you persuasively communicate the opportunity (or risk) to stakeholders?

Your task is to analyze benchmark data from two comparable California airports
(Salinas and Watsonville Municipal Airports) and create compelling
visualizations that support a clear recommendation about the development
opportunity.

## Key Information

- **Type**: Individual project
- **Due Date**: December 11, 2025 (15:59 PM)
- **Weight**: 40% of final grade
- **Case**: UVA-BC-0285 (available on Moodle)
- **Data**: Salinas and Watsonville airport housing datasets (UVA-BC-0285X)

:::

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will:

1. **Apply persuasive visualization techniques** to support business recommendations
2. **Design for multiple audiences** with different backgrounds and information needs
3. **Handle multidimensional data** (price, distance, noise levels, time)
4. **Create narrative flow** that guides stakeholders through your analysis
5. **Balance analytical rigor with clarity** for non-technical audiences
6. **Make defensible design choices** grounded in visualization principles

## Case Questions to Address

Your analysis must answer the following:

::: {.callout-warning}
## Required Analysis Questions

1. **Proximity Analysis**: How does distance from the airport terminal correlate with housing values in the benchmark markets (Salinas and Watsonville)?

2. **Noise Impact Assessment**: What is the relationship between Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and property values? Is the Noise Depreciation Index (NDI) of 0.45%-0.64% supported by the data?

3. **Market Segmentation**: Are there patterns suggesting different market segments respond differently to airport proximity?

4. **Comparative Analysis**: How do the two benchmark airports (Salinas vs. Watsonville) compare? What explains any differences?

5. **Confounding Factors**: What other variables beyond noise and distance might be influencing the housing values you observe?

6. **Investment Recommendation**: Should PDC pursue this development opportunity? What are the key risks and opportunities?

## Data Description

You will work with two datasets:

### Salinas Municipal Airport Dataset

- **Properties analyzed**: Houses at varying distances from terminal
- **Distance range**: 0.64 to 3.67 miles from terminal
- **Noise categories**: 
  - ≥60 dB CNEL
  - 55-60 dB CNEL
  - <55 dB CNEL
- **Variables**: Property values, distances, noise levels, time series data

### Watsonville Municipal Airport Dataset

- **Properties analyzed**: Houses at varying distances from terminal
- **Distance range**: 0.71 to 2.02 miles from terminal
- **Noise categories**:
  - ≥65 dB CNEL
  - 60-65 dB CNEL
  - <60 dB CNEL
- **Variables**: Property values, distances, noise levels, time series data

::: {.callout-tip}
## Understanding CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level)

CNEL measures 24-hour noise exposure with penalties for evening/night noise:

- **Quiet urban area (day)**: 50 dB
- **Quiet urban area (night)**: 40 dB
- **Countryside (night)**: 20-25 dB
- **Discomfort threshold**: >120 dB
- **Pain threshold**: >130 dB
- **Rocket launch**: ~200 dB

For context: rustling leaves ≈ 20 dB, normal conversation ≈ 60 dB, lawnmower ≈ 90 dB

Your analysis must include at least:

1. **One visualization showing the relationship between distance and property value**
2. **One visualization showing the relationship between noise levels and property value**
3. **One comparative visualization** contrasting Salinas and Watsonville
4. **One multidimensional visualization** integrating 3+ variables

## Academic Integrity

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Reminders

- This is an **individual project** - all work must be your own
- You may **discuss concepts** with classmates but not share code or visualizations
- **Cite all sources** including online tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, or AI assistance
- **Use provided data** - do not supplement with external datasets
- **Original visualizations** - do not copy designs from online examples
- Violations will be handled according to university academic integrity policies
:::

## Success Tips

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recommendations for Excellence

1. **Start early**: Complex decisions require time to develop nuanced arguments
2. **Iterate often**: First drafts of visualizations are rarely final versions
3. **Seek feedback**: Use office hours to validate your approach
4. **Think like your audience**: Partners care about ROI, investors about risk
5. **Question your assumptions**: What if your initial hypothesis is wrong?
6. **Design with purpose**: Every element should serve your narrative
7. **Test your code**: Make sure everything runs before submission
8. **Proofread everything**: Typos undermine professional credibility
9. **Save incrementally**: Version control or frequent backups
10. **Keep it simple**: Clarity beats complexity

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use interactive visualizations?** A: Yes, but your final
presentation must be a PDF. You can include static screenshots of interactive
visualizations with annotations explaining the interactive features.

**Q: How technical should the presentation be?** A: Balance is key. Your
audience includes both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Explain
concepts clearly without oversimplifying or using jargon unnecessarily.

**Q: Should I recommend for or against the development?** A: Either conclusion
can be correct if well-supported by evidence. The quality of your reasoning
and visualization matters more than your specific recommendation.

**Q: Can I use external data sources?** A: No. Use only the provided Salinas
and Watsonville datasets. You may reference external information for context
(e.g., NDI research) but not add external data to your analysis.

**Q: What if I find data quality issues?** A: Document them in your
limitations section and explain how you handled them. Real-world data is
messy.

**Q: How many visualizations should I include?** A: Quality over quantity.
6-10 excellent visualizations that tell a coherent story are better than 15
mediocre ones.

**Q: Can I work with others?** A: This is an individual project. You may
discuss general concepts but all analysis, code, and visualizations must be
your own original work.

This project is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of data visualization
principles in a realistic business context. Focus on creating visualizations
that don't just show data, but reveal insights and persuade stakeholders. Good
luck!
