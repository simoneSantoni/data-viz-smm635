## Overview

The course includes two main projects that allow you to apply data visualization principles to real-world data:

1. **Midterm Project** (Week 6) - Individual static visualization project
2. **Final Project** (Week 11) - Group interactive visualization project

## Midterm Project (30%)

### Objectives
Create a comprehensive static visualization report that demonstrates your understanding of design principles and technical skills.

### Requirements
- Use a dataset of your choice (minimum 1000 observations)
- Create at least 5 different visualization types
- Apply appropriate color schemes and typography
- Include written analysis and design justifications
- Submit as a PDF report (8-10 pages)

### Deliverables
1. Project proposal (Week 3)
2. Data exploration notebook
3. Final visualization report
4. Code repository

## Final Project (40%)

### Objectives  
Work in teams to create an interactive dashboard or data story that provides insights into a complex dataset.

### Requirements
- Teams of 2-3 students
- Interactive elements (filters, hover, zoom)
- Multiple coordinated views
- Responsive design
- Clear narrative structure

### Deliverables
1. Project proposal (Week 7)
2. Design mockups
3. Interactive visualization (deployed)
4. Technical documentation
5. Team presentation (Week 10)

## Project Guidelines

### Choosing a Dataset
- Publicly available data
- Sufficient complexity for analysis
- Ethical considerations addressed
- Novel insights possible

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Design** (30%): Aesthetics, clarity, appropriateness
- **Technical** (30%): Code quality, functionality, performance
- **Analysis** (25%): Insights, storytelling, accuracy
- **Documentation** (15%): Clarity, completeness, reproducibility

## Timeline
