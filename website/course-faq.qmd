## General Questions

### Do I need prior programming experience?
Basic programming knowledge in either Python or R is required. You should be comfortable with:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Basic data manipulation

If you're rusty, we recommend completing a refresher tutorial before the course starts.

### Can I use only Python or only R?
Yes! While we teach both languages to give you flexibility, you can complete all assignments in your preferred language. The final project can mix languages if desired.

### Is this course suitable for designers without coding experience?
This course emphasizes both design principles and technical implementation. While we welcome students from design backgrounds, you'll need basic programming skills to succeed. Consider taking an introductory programming course first.

### How much time should I budget for this course?
Plan for approximately 10 hours per week:
- 2 hours lectures
- 2 hours labs  
- 6 hours self-study, assignments, and projects

## Technical Questions

### What computer specifications do I need?
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, any OS
- **Recommended**: 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, dedicated graphics card
- Lab computers are available if your laptop doesn't meet requirements

### Can I use my tablet/iPad?
Tablets are great for reading and sketching, but you'll need a laptop or desktop for coding assignments. Cloud-based options like Google Colab can work in a pinch.

### Which IDE should I use?
We recommend:
- **Python**: VS Code or JupyterLab
- **R**: RStudio
- **Both**: VS Code with appropriate extensions

Choose what you're comfortable with!

### Do I need to install everything before the first class?
No, we'll have an installation party during the first lab. However, attempting installation beforehand helps identify issues early.

## Assignment Questions

### Can I submit assignments late?
Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day. After 5 days, assignments won't be accepted. See syllabus for emergency extension policy.

### How are group projects graded?
Group projects receive a base grade, with individual adjustments based on:
- Peer evaluations
- Individual contribution statements
- Git commit history

### Can I use code from the internet?
Yes, with proper attribution! You must:
- Cite all sources
- Understand any code you use
- Adapt it to your specific needs
- Never copy entire solutions

### What constitutes plagiarism in visualization?
- Copying code without attribution
- Reproducing others' visualizations without credit
- Submitting others' work as your own
- Using generative AI without disclosure

## Project Questions

### Can I use my work/research data for projects?
Absolutely! Real-world data makes projects more meaningful. Ensure:
- You have permission to use the data
- No confidential information is included
- Data is appropriately anonymized
- You can share it with classmates for peer review

### What makes a good final project?
Strong final projects typically:
- Tell a compelling data story
- Use appropriate visualization techniques
- Include interactive elements
- Show technical proficiency
- Demonstrate design principles
- Are well-documented

### Can I continue working on my project after the course?
Yes! Many students develop their projects into:
- Portfolio pieces
- Research publications
- Open-source contributions
- Startup ideas

## Career Questions

### What careers use data visualization?
- Data Scientist/Analyst
- Business Intelligence Developer
- UX/UI Designer
- Data Journalist
- Research Scientist
- Product Manager
- Consultant

### Should I specialize in one tool or learn many?
We recommend:
1. Master one language deeply (Python or R)
2. Understand multiple tools' capabilities
3. Learn underlying principles that transfer
4. Stay curious about new developments

### How do I build a visualization portfolio?
- Complete all course projects thoughtfully
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Participate in visualization challenges
- Create personal projects with interesting data
- Document your process, not just results

## Practical Matters

### Is lecture attendance mandatory?
Lectures aren't mandatory but strongly encouraged. We don't record lectures to encourage participation and discussion. Slides are posted after class.

### Can I audit the course?
Contact the instructor to discuss auditing options. Auditors are welcome in lectures but may have limited access to labs and computing resources.

### Are there prerequisites I should review?
Review these topics before the course:
- Basic statistics (mean, median, distributions)
- Data manipulation (filtering, grouping, joining)
- File I/O in your chosen language

### How do I get help if I'm struggling?
1. Attend office hours early and often
2. Form study groups
3. Post on the course forum
4. Visit TA hours
5. Reach out to the instructor

Don't wait until you're behind!
