# Mid-term project - README

# Scope of the MTP:

Community structures are ubiquitous both in the economy and in complex
networks such as Reddit . However,  there are are not shared
guidelines/established practices on how to carry out a community detection
analysis on network data. Actually, network analysts have produced a plethora
of different algorithms/approaches that ― when applied to the same dataset ―
could produce different results.

For this mid-term project, groups are required:

+ to conduct a review of the literature covering substantive and computational
aspects of the community detection problem. At minimum, the review should
cover five (5) applications ― i.e., projects using a community a lens to
investigate a concrete business or managerial problem ― and five (5)
methodological articles ― i.e, technical projects proposing a community detection
algorithm;
+ to compare and contrast the results achieved by running multiple community
detection  algorithms on the same network dataset. Students can re-use an
existing algorithm that is already implemented in Python; implement for the
first time an existing algorithm in Python; or design and implement a
brand-new algorithm;
+ to prepare a slide-show presenting the critical insights and results
emerging from the literature review and network analysis application.

# Rationales for the MTP

 This mid-term project is a great opportunity for students:

 + to create a literature review workflow that they can redeploy in the
  context of the ARP, the final course project, or in a future job;
 + to solve practical problems by implementing cutting edge tools.

# Data

Students are free to pick-up the network dataset that best fits with their purpose of comparing and contrasting alternative community detection algorithms. There are many collections of network datasets across the web. For example, the website of the [SNAP project](http://snap.stanford.edu/) offers a decent choice. The students can also simulate one or multiple datasets having characteristics that are important for the comparative
analysis (e.g., students may want to simulate a 'null case', that is, a network that does not exhibit any community structure).

# Deliverables

By November 11 (8:00 PM), students are supposed to upload the following onto Moodle:

+   the Python code of the project;
+   the above mentioned presentaton in .pptx, .md, or .pdf (generated via the LaTeX class 'beamer')

Concise documents with high per word added value are welcome.
