# Final Course Project Description

Predicting link formation in online settings is one of the most critical
tasks data scientists have to deal with. In fact, link formation dynamics
help to solve several business problems, such as:

+ explaining the popularity of products in online marketplaces
+ building recommender systems (see last year final course project)
+ placing ads (e.g., ads concerning job posts) in the right spot so as
  to maximise the returns and attract more 'customers'

For this final course project, groups are required to analyze the Stackoverflow
setting and to address the following question: Why do users participate in certain
threads â€“ i.e., reply to certain questions?

# References

Your textbook 'Networks, Crowds, and Markets' has some chapters that are
key to the design and execute the project, such as chapters 3, 4, 19, 20, 21,
23.

# Data

There are several dumps of the Stackoverflow platform:

+ [official dump](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries)
+ [Archive dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)
+ [SNAP dump](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html)
+ Simone's dump (available upon request)


## Deliverables

By December 20 (5:00 PM), groups have to upload the following set of materials:

+ copy of Python scripts and/or the Jupyter notebook
+ supporting documentation (.md/.tex format) reporting:
  - a description of the netwrok analytics pipeline you have created (including
      models, metrics, algorithms, etc.);
  - an effective, concise description of the key insights emerging from
      the network analyses.
