# Mid-term project

Core-periphery (CP) structures are ubiquitous in the economy [(Csermely
 et al., 2013 â€“ Journal of Complex Networks)](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-abstract/1/2/93/2392115). However,
there is a scant of guidelines/established practices on how to conduct CP
 analyses on network data.

 Recently, several practitioners from the industry and network scholars have
  started to work on the topic and proposed their 'CP' algorithm. As a
   result, there are a plethora of different algorithms/approaches. For
 this mid-term project, groups are required:

+ to conduct a review of the literature covering substantive and
 computational aspects of the CP detection problem. At minimum, ten (10)
  applications and ten (10) methodological articles should be retrieved;
+ to compare and contrast the results achieved by running two CP
 algorithms on the same network dataset. Students can re-use an existing
  algorithm that is already implemented in Python, implement for the first
   time an existing algorithm in Python, or design and implement a brand-new
    algorithm;
+ to prepare a PowerPoint slide-show presenting the critical insights and
 results emerging from the literature review and network analysis application.

 This mid-term project is a great opportunity for students:

 + to create a literature review workflow that they can redeploy in the
  context of the ARP, final course project, or in you future job;
 + to solve practical problems by implementing cutting edge tools.


# Deliverables

By November 12 (8:00 PM), groups have to upload the following set of
 materials:

+ copy of Python scripts and/or the Jupyter notebook;
+ copy of the PowerPoint/LaTeX presentation (including the bibliography);
+ if the group produces a new CP algorithm, a companion documentation file
 should be uploaded (.md/.tex format)
