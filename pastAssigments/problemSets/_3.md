# Problem Set 3 ― README

**Task:** The problem set comprises one point only:

1.  Use NumPy & SciPy to implement an algorithm that tests for the presence of
homophily in networks ― i.e., the extent to which present ties involve
homogeneous nodes

**Context**: As you work on the problem, keep the below in mind:

-   both real and synthetic network datasets could be used to show the functioning of the algorithm;
-   irrespective of the nature of the data (real or synthetic), I suggest:
    +   to focus on one attribute of nodes (being age, gender, ethnicity, or some preference);
    +   to consider a one-mode, non-directed, and unweighted network.

**Submission**: Submit your solution via email to simone.santoni.1@city.ac.uk.
Late submissions (> October 28, 2020) may not be considered for the in-class
presentations.
