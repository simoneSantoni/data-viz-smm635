# Problem set 6 â€” README

This problem set is based on two data sources:

- Kaggle's ['Star Wars Social Network'][kaggle_data]
- Wikipedia's entry for [Star Wars characters][characters]

Use the theory and tools illustrated in week 4, to measure the extent to which
the network of communication between Star Wars characters exhibits
homophily with respect to the categories 'humans' and 'other sentient species'.

__May the force be with you.__
