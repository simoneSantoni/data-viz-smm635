# Python environments for SMM635 â€“ README

Three distinct environments should be created:

+   a general purpose environment
+   one for geospatial data visualization
+   another for creating dashboards

The text files included in this folder contain the core libraries that should populate the three environments. Whilst not necessary, additional libraries could complement the core ones.
