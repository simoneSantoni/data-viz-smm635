\section{Project Description}

Consider the Human Resources
Dataset.\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set}}
Then, make the following assumptions. First, you are a junior business analyst
working for a global consultancy company. Second, the data regards the company
AlfaBetaGamma, your employer's client. Third, you are supposed to contribute to
creating a deck to use for a meeting with the client. Specifically,  you are
supposed to create a set of visualizations that help to address the following
questions raised by the client:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How do employees' performance scores change within and across managers? 
	\item What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
	\item What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
	\item What are the most frequent factors for job termination?
	\item Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deliverables}

By November 14\textsuperscript{th}, the students must submit:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	One Matplotlib visualization for each of the five questions above 
	\item 
	The Python code necessary to replicate the Matplotlib visualizations
	\item  
	An executive summary covering the following aspect
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
		The design choices behind the proposed visualizations
		\item 
		The rationale behind the individual design choices
		\item 
		A set of actionable business analytics recommendations that are
		grounded in the main results of the project
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The students are required to use the provided template --- available in .docx
and .tex format --- and respect the word limits applying to the various
boxes/sections of the template. The total length of the document is 2,500 words.

\section{Key Features of the Dataset}

The dataset contains 311 observations (aka, employees) and 36 variables, whose 
meaning is described in Table \ref{tab:codebook}.
